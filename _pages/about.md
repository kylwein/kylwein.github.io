Hey there! I’m Kyle Weiner, a third-year Data Science student at the University of Florida with a passion for AI, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Right now, I’m diving into research, using AI models to solve problems involving protein-peptide interactions. I also have fun building mechanical keyboards and love swimming whenever I can.

I’m proficient in C++, Python, R, SQL, and Tableau, with a focus on AI frameworks like PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow. I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and push the boundaries of what AI can do!
